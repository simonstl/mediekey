A project centered around a .klc file is weirdly different from most programming projects.  Partly, there's the joy of GitHub thinking it's binary, when it's text underneath, but most of the challenges lie in the projects. People typically apply custom keyboard layouts when they're facing a document or set of documents that had a creative writer or typesetter, and they need to capture something fairly unique.

I suspect that most people who want to use this file will either just use it as is, or have a long list of characters that they want to make accessible.  If you want to add a long list of characters, please feel extremely welcome to fork the project and use it as a base for whatever you're working on. If you think that your version is a substantial improvement for most users, absolutely send me a pull request and I'll see whether it's a good candidate for combination.

If you need only a few characters added, and aren't comfortable working with [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339), please let me know. If it seems like something a lot of people use, I might add it.

I will definitely not be surprised if I prove to be the only contributor to this one.  I will not even be surprised if I am the only one to use it.
